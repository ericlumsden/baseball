## When should you start to worry?

During a recent Red Sox v Orioles game, Joe Castiglione and Will Flemming were discussing the slow start to the season. Being only 16 innings in to the 2021 campaign at the time they were cautious, but still maintained that the lack of energy and signs of any spark had them a bit worried. The Sox wouldn't score again in that game, eventually losing 4-2. The game after? The Orioles crushed them, 11-3, to complete the sweep. Through their first 27 innings of baseball the Red Sox had amassed only 5 runs on 15 hits while giving up 18 runs on 34 hits, all while facing the team projected to be [fourth worst in baseball by Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/depthcharts.aspx?position=Standings). The Boston sports media is [notoriously negative](https://www.boston.com/sports/media/2018/02/11/bill-simmons-boston-sports-media), but there were shades of previous underperforming versions of the Red Sox in those 16 innings. It made me curious: how early is too early to be worried about a slow start?

## Takeaways

After their slow start, the Red Sox went on a tear, sweeping the reigning AL champion Tampa Bay Rays, scoring 26 runs on 39 hits over that three game series, and then getting their revenge on the Orioles by sweeping them in their home opening series, scoring 27 runs on 39 hits. Their pitching also performed much better in those two series holding the Rays and Orioles to a total of 25 runs on 43 hits over those 6 games. AS WE'VE SEEN, IT DOESN'T MEAN A WHOLE LOT or... GIVEN THEIR LACK OF ANY OFFENSE, IT MIGHT BE TIME TO START WORRYING SOME or... IF THIS TREND CONTINUES ALARM BELLS SHOULD START RINGING SOON
